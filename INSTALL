## Configuring

To configure the destination directory:

	make configure PREFIX=/your/dir

By default, all files will be installed in /usr/local/ directory (actually
/usr/local/bin and /usr/local/share/locale).

## Building and installing

Type

	make
	make install

or if you wish to copy to another directory first, aka I'm building a package.

	make
	make install PREFIX=/your/dir


## Dependencies
	* gtk+ 2
	* glib 2
	* dbus
	* xlock (optional)

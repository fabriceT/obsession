What are these programs for?

* obsession-logout,

  suspend or hibernate the computer.

* obsession-exit,
  this is the command line version of obsession-logout.

* xdg-autostart,
  start automaticaly programs defined in /etc/xdg/autostart and ~/.config/autostart
  (see FreeDesktop specification for autostarted programs). Add it to your
  ~/.openbox/autostart file and manage your session with lxsession-edit or other.
  Use -d parameter to set your desktop environment (i.e. KDE, XFCE, ROX...). Refer to 
  this table: http://standards.freedesktop.org/menu-spec/latest/apb.html). By default,
  xdg-autostart uses Openbox as desktop environment name.


Why?

I'm a big fan of Openbox and LXDE, but I don't need all the features of the
last one. So starting from LXDE project and keeping what is useful (to me)
was a good start to have a desktop easy to manage and very lightweight.

This is so old school!

Yes but it works with ConsoleKit, UPower and systemd.
